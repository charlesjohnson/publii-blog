I have to confess a certain amount of hopelessness about national politics, as fascism and political violence seem prevalent. I always used to scoff when people of my parent's generation told me Gen-X would fuck up the country, but here we are, and they were right.<br><br>Still, California will remain solidly Democratic this election, with the supermajority unlikely to be truly challenged.

As David pointed out, the League of Pissed-Off Voters recommends voting yes on everybody. Honestly, that's good enough for me.</p>\n<h1 id=\"state-superintendent-of-public-instruction-tony-thurmond\">State Superintendent of Public Instruction</h1>\n<p>David points out this is a \"reasonable person vs. Christian fascist wacko\" race. Christensen wants to bring staff-led prayer to schools. Vote for Tony Thurmond.</p>\n<h1 id=\"district-attorney-pamela-price\">County Supervisor</h1>\n<p>This is a tragic race. The incumbent, Wilma Chan, was struck and killed by a motorist about a year ago. Chan was a significant loss for the region. But we have an embarrassment of riches here: Lena Tam was an excellent vice-mayor for Alameda, and I loved being her constituent. I've voted for her before; she'd do a good job. Kaplan was vice mayor of Oakland and is a single-issue candidate focused on homelessness. That's very attractive, and she's proposing innovative solutions. We won't go wrong either way.</p>\n<h1 id=\"district-attorney-pamela-price\">District Attorney</h1>\n<p>David has written glowing recommendations for Pamela Price in the past. Pamela has the criminal reform endorsements, and Terry Wiley has the political machine endorsements. I don't think either will be a disaster, but David's considerable enthusiasm tilts me toward Pamela.</p>\n<h1>AUSD Governing Board</h1>\n<p>I mainly want to ensure this wasn't one of those races where the Trumpists are trying to get some COVID-denier Trumpist shithead onto the school board. Fortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case. That said, all the candidate information online is pretty milquetoast, so in the end, I went with the California Teacher's Association endorsements.</p>\n<h1>AC Transit Races</h1>\n<p>David has glowing recommendations for Alfred Twu, and Sarah Syed's credentials and experience are extremely impressive. These both seem like no-brainers.</p>\n<h1>City of Alameda Mayor</h1>\n<p>Marilyn Ashcraft has been an excellent mayor of Alameda. Between COVID and the state legislature entering into a pro-growth-or-else posture toward city governments, she's done a fantastic job. She brought us through the COVID emergency while minimizing the economic impact on local business, has shepherded the city through creating a compliant California Housing Element, and the city transit plans designed under her leadership emphasize bicycles and pedestrians over cars. In addition, city council meetings once again run smoothly on her watch. It's been hard to lead a city in California, and Mayor Ashcraft has been a formidable wartime mayor.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Ashcraft has been pro-tenant in a city where more than half of residents are renters. That's a big deal, even for homeowners like me.</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Also, I'm a single-issue voter in city politics, and that issue is whether the owners of the Harbor Bay Club will be allowed to redevelop their site. Earlier this year, </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://alamedasun.com/news/development-company-applies-redevelop-harbor-bay-club-site\" class=\"editor-rtfLink\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">some jackasses proposed bulldozing the run-down tennis club next to my house and replacing it with an apartment tower featuring a 600-space parking garage, about 60 feet from my house, with the garage entrance pointed directly at my front door</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. That proposal was ultimately defeated, but it's hardly the last attempt at redevelopment by the people who own the site. </span>Ashcraft hasn't precisely committed to opposing such a development, but she's spoken in that direction:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"\">\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"gmail_quote\">\n<div class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"\">According to Planning, Building &amp; Transportation Director Andrew Thomas, \"It is not an unreasonable request\" to change the current zoning of the Harbor Bay Club (HBC) to make it consistent with the site's General Plan designation which is \"Commercial Recreation\" and would preclude housing. Mr. Thomas also noted significant concerns with the HBC site, including the need to address sea level rise. I have worked with Mr. Thomas since 2006 when I was appointed to the Planning Board and find his reasoning thorough and persuasive.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's not an \"I would definitely oppose development there,\" but it's good enough for me.</p>\n<p>All that said, I wasn't in love with how her government handled multiple police scandals, including the murder of a man in custody. On the contrary, I'm disappointed by the lack of consequences for the officers involved. But I voted for Ashcraft once, and I'll do it again.</p>\n<p>By contrast, her opponent Trish Spencer is a trash fire of a candidate. Spencer was the incumbent ousted by Ashcraft, and her time as mayor was chaos. Multiple scandals. Alameda-sized scandals, but still. Council meetings ran long. Police quit in droves. People in city hall found her difficult.</p>\n<p>Spencer's been on the city council since losing the mayoral race, and her time on the city council has been characterized by obstruction and NIMBYism.</p>\n<p>Vote yes on Ashcraft. But just as important, vote no on Spencer.</p>\n<h1>City of Alameda City Council</h1>\n<p>The Alameda City Council race is crowded this year, with six candidates vying for two open positions. The election determines whether we'll have a progressive vs. moderate majority in the city council. The progressives will continue to push alternatives to cars in our transit plan and favor renter protections. Moderates will go hard against tenant protections, oppose building more housing, and likely continue the typical California NIMBY tactics to slow growth.</p>\n<p>I favor Hannah Groce and Paul Beusterien (a controversial choice). Tracy Jensen is also a great candidate and my alternate to Paul B.</p>\n<p>It seems like I don't need to explain my choice for Hannah Groce very much. She's got the progressive bona fides; she'll do great.</p>\n<p>I favor Paul Beusterien for two reasons. First, we don't have anyone representing my neighborhood on the city council, and Paul's from Bay Farm. More than that, he serves on the master HOA board that covers nearly 4000 households and does so well. If you'd like to check for yourself, his voting record as part of that HOA board is an open record. I think he's ready to level up to full city council.</p>\n<p>But that's not enough to get me behind him entirely in a race that has this many candidates. What gets me over the line is that I am confident that Paul will be on my side in the fight against the redevelopment of the Harbor Bay Club site. Paul actually came to our neighborhood, talked with us about the issue, and listened. No other candidate has done so.<br><br>Paul generally favors solutions that protect the tennis club site as recreation and wants to find ways to restore it to vibrancy. I prefer non-commercial solutions myself, but this is close enough. He has my vote.</p>\n<h1>Measure 1 (legal abortion)</h1>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hell yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This measure will enshrine the right to abortion, birth control, and the right to refuse birth control into the state constitution. With forced birth now the law of the land in half of the country, the USA needs us to lead here. It's a no-brainer.</span></p>\n<h1>Measure 26 (expand tribal casinos)</h1>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>I guess yes.</strong> I dislike gambling; I've seen it ruin too many lives. But I favor tribal sovereignty and dislike prohibitions. So I'll hold my nose and vote yes.</span></p>\n<h1>Measure 27 (online sports betting)</h1>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>No. </strong>Another gambling proposition. Again, I dislike prohibitions, but Measure 28 is designed as a corporate end-run around the California state legislature, who could pass laws legalizing this type of betting if they wanted to. They don't, so well-funded predators are trying to capture business from the tribal casinos via ballot initiative. Fuck these people.</span></p>\n<h1>Measure 28 (arts in schools)</h1>\n<p><strong>Hell yes. </strong>It sucks that we have to do all this dancing around Prop 13, but we do. Every kid in California should have this opportunity, and underfunded schools deserve arts programs.</p>\n<h1>Measure 29 (Dialysis Clinics Again)</h1>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Unions have been trying to protect the workers in California dialysis clinics for a long time, and powerful medical lobbies have effectively shut them out. The unions have been attempting to get worker protections on the ballot in the last few elections, and every time they get outspent ten to one and lose. The clinics claim they'll all close down if they treat their workers like human beings, and then all their patients will die.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The unions are trying again this year, and the (wildly profitable) dialysis clinic companies are trotting out ads featuring old ladies begging us not to murder them. It's sick.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I'm pro-union, and I doubt any clinics will close as a result if this passes, but it won't. So I'm voting yes anyway.</span></p>\n<h1>Measure 30 (Tax the rich to fund electric cars)</h1>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So Lyft will save some money, so fucking what? We're in a climate emergency, and the rich don't have to pay federal income taxes. Make their accountants earn those fees by dancing around this tax too. The worst case scenario here, if it passes, is that we get more electric cars, and billionaires don't buy their way out of future taxes at the ballot. Tax the rich! What's controversial about that?</span></p>\n<h1>Measure 31 (Keep law banning flavored tobacco)</h1>\n<p><strong>Soft yes.</strong> Measure 31 is a big company trying to buy a veto on the state legislature via a ballot initiative. Again, I don't like prohibitions, but I dislike big corporations trying to buy their way around the state legislature even more. Fight it there, not at the ballot initiative, and support representative democracy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alameda-county-d-more-buildings-on-agricultural-land-yes\">Alameda County D (buildings on agricultural land)</h2>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This one is deep policy wonk stuff. Alameda County prohibits building on many agricultural lands; this allows limited development for equestrian and agricultural buildings. The county supervisors support it, and the Sierra Club has no opinion, so I will trust the supervisors to do their jobs.</span></p>\n<h1>City of Alameda E (City council pay increases)</h1>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Hell Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Serving in elected city leadership in Alameda pays jack shit. City council members make $1200 a year, and the mayor makes $3600 a year. It's a part-time job in a city structured in a weak-mayor, strong-city-manager way, but those numbers are too low. We're asking our elected officials to work for free, which cuts everyone out of the pool who can't afford to do that.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pay would jump to $25,000 for the city council in 2023. Future pay increases would be based on a formula not to exceed 30 percent of the median Bay Area annual salary, which is... weird? But not unreasonable. They haven't had a raise since the 1970s; we should do it.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you want professionals in the job, pay them like professionals.</span></p>\n<h1>City of Alameda F (Hotel taxes)</h1>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This increases the hotel tax to 14%, in line with other cities in the area. It sucks because it's a direct voting tax, not something the city council can set itself. But that's life in California for you. But I don't see a downside beyond entrenching our existing government dysfunction.</span></p>",
