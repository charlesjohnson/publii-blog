    In 2018, Gene Kim and John Willis released <a href="https://itrevolution.com/product/beyond-the-phoenix-project/" title="IT Revolution Press" target="_blank"><i>Beyond the Phoenix Project</i></a>, a nine-part audio series that digs into the philosophical roots of the DevOps movement. It's an excellent supplement to <a href="https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/" title="IT Revolution Press" target="_blank"><i>The Phoenix Project</i></a>. Where the novel shows the pain, the audio series explains why it hurts. But because it’s an audio companion piece, most people have never heard it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The part that’s most stuck with me over the years is what Kim calls “the five predictable bottlenecks of software delivery.” They’re numbered 1-5, and you must solve them in order. No skipping ahead. They go like this:

  <p>
    AI development doesn't eliminate these bottlenecks. It just slams you into the next one faster. Face-first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the last few years, every time I've presented at a tech conference, I've included a slide on the bottlenecks. I always tell people, "If you're going to take a picture of one slide from this presentation, make it this one." It's the single most useful mental model I've found for diagnosing why a software organization is slow.<br>
  </p>

    <h2 id="the-bottlenecks-explained">
      The Bottlenecks Explained
    </h2>

    <h2 id="environments">
      Environments
    </h2>

  <p>
    At the first bottleneck, your teams are stuck waiting for environments. Somebody has to provision the infrastructure, configure DNS, file a ticket to open the firewall, and wait. The fix to this is on-demand environment creation: press the button, get a runtime, whether dev, staging, or prod. Automate creation. Make new ones all the time, throw away the old ones. Make it self-service. Move on.
  </p>

    <h2 id="deployment">
      Deployment
    </h2>

  <p>
    Next is deployment. Once you can create environments, you’ll likely realize pushing code to them is its own nightmare. Too many steps, too many handoffs, too many pieces to coordinate. Kim emphasizes that teams should build their deployments as a single-piece flow.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    In a factory, batch production means you make 500 units of part A, then 500 units of part B, then assemble them all at once. But batches hide defects and slow the line to the speed of the worst delay; a flaw replicated 500 times takes longer to unwind. By contrast, single-piece flow means one unit moves through every station before the next unit starts. You catch problems immediately. Nothing queues. The system moves continuously, and defects are caught and resolved quickly.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    In software, the equivalent is one change, one deploy. Not ten features bundled into a release train, or a quarterly mega-release window. One commit moves through build, test, and deploy before you start the next. It does so in seconds. The goal is to make deployments so routine that they disappear from thought entirely.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Developers have traditionally resisted single-piece flow, not because they lack discipline, but because the system has historically punished it. When deploys take 45 minutes, and a failed build might page you at 2 AM, batching is rational. It’s not laziness; you’re amortizing risk and overhead. Batching is what happens when tool use is expensive and failure is loud. Developers learned to do it because the system demanded it.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Claude Code doesn’t have that instinct because it never paid those costs. When Superpowers manages implementation, it breaks work into tightly scoped tasks. Dependent tasks run sequentially. Independent tasks run in parallel, each in its own worktree. Either way, each task is a single piece moving through implementation, test, and review before completion. When parallel tasks finish, Claude reconciles the work and handles the merge. It is not batching. It is multiple single-piece flows running at once.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    On the web, each session runs in its own sandboxed environment, isolated by design. Same principle. Different mechanism.<br>
  </p>

    <h2 id="testing">
      Testing
    </h2>

  <p>
    You're deploying fast, but you're shipping bugs faster. Every change surface needs a test. You need confidence that what you shipped actually works. They need to be the right tests, and they need to be fast.
  </p>

    <h2 id="architecture">
      Architecture
    </h2>

  <p>
    Congratulations! You've got tests, fast deploys, and on-demand runtimes for every work context. Now the codebase itself is the problem. Tech debt accumulates. Components become so tightly coupled that changing one thing breaks three others. You need to pay this all down regularly and keep things loosely coupled enough so the system can evolve.
  </p>

    <h2 id="ideas">
      Ideas
    </h2>

  <p>
    Here is where Kim says the bottleneck should be. When environments spin up on demand, deployments are trivial, tests are fast and comprehensive, and architecture is clean, the limiting factor becomes how fast humans can come up with good things to build. The speed of ingenuity.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s where you want to live, all the time.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a radical statement in 2018. For a lot of organizations, it still is today.
  </p>

    <h2 id="this-all-still-applies-to-your-agentic-coding-projects">
      This All Still Applies to Your Agentic Coding Projects
    </h2>

  <p>
    As I’ve been getting comfortable using Claude Code on the web, connected directly to my GitHub repos, I keep coming back to Kim's framework. It maps perfectly to how agentic development projects succeed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bottlenecks are the same. The order is the same. And if you don't address them, you'll stall in the same places, no matter how advanced the model writing your code.
  </p>

    <h2 id="environment-creation">
      Environment Creation
    </h2>

  <p>
    Claude Code on the web can see your repo and push branches. But if you can’t actually see what it builds, you’ve got a bottleneck. The goal is a preview environment for every PR.
  </p>

  <p>
    For frontend projects, tools like <a href="https://vite.dev/" title="Vite" target="_blank">Vite</a> paired with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" title="Netlify" target="_blank">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/" title="Vercel" target="_blank">Vercel</a> give you this almost for free. Every pull request gets a deploy preview with a clickable URL. For infrastructure-heavy projects, <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform" title="Terraform" target="_blank">Terraform</a> with <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" title="GitHub Action" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a> can spin up ephemeral staging environments on demand, scoped to the branch and torn down when the PR closes.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    The specifics depend on your stack, but the principle doesn’t. Regardless of how you run your coding agent, when it finishes a task and pushes a branch, you should be able to see the result running somewhere real, with a full copy of the stack, and full resource isolation. If that’s not the case, fix that first. Everything downstream depends on it.
  </p>

    <h2 id="code-deployment">
      Code Deployment
    </h2>

  <p>
    Once your preview environments exist, the question becomes, how does code get there? The answer should be the same code pipeline that deploys to production. Same mechanism, same gates, every time. A push to a branch triggers a preview. A merge to main triggers staging. A tagged release triggers production. The same code deploys it all, the only difference is the target.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Claude Code on the web already pushes branches to remote when it finishes a task. Meet it halfway. Make sure your pipeline picks up from there without human intervention.
  </p>

  <p>
    GitHub Actions makes this straightforward. Define workflow triggers that match each stage: a push to any PR branch deploys a preview. a merge to main deploys to staging. A release tag deploys to production. Three workflows, same deployment logic, different targets. The pipeline definition lives in the repo alongside the code, so Claude can see it, understand it, and even modify it as the project evolves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here’s the catch: Because agents don’t batch, it’s common to have parallel tasks finishing within minutes, each opening a pull request, each triggering a preview environment. A pipeline that might have worked fine for a team of humans deploying a few times a day might buckle under an agent that treats deployment as a function call. Integration environments like staging will still serialize by design, but the concurrency pressure shows up earlier, in previews and development targets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your deployment pipeline will need to support concurrent builds without shared state between resources. If your automation can’t handle multiple simultaneous pushes to dev environments without choking, that’s the bottleneck.
  </p>

    <h2 id="testing">
      Testing
    </h2>

  <p>
    As I wrote in <a href="https://blog.chipjohnson.net/clarity-is-the-new-bottleneck.html" target="_blank">my last post</a>, Jesse Vincent's <a href="https://github.com/obra/superpowers" title="Superpowers" target="_blank">Superpowers</a> plugin enforces real red-green-refactor test-driven development. Every change gets an executable definition of success before implementation starts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even with TDD enforced, though, agents will happily generate code with test coverage that looks comprehensive but tests implementation rather than observable behavior. The tests pass because the agent wrote them to pass, not because they validate anything a user would care about.
  </p>

  <p>
    But now that you’ve built proper preview environments, you can go further. Run <a href="https://playwright.dev/" title="Playwright" target="_blank">Playwright</a> tests against a real deployment. Exercise actual infrastructure with integration tests. Your agent can help write these tests and handle the syntax, but you still have to specify what “working” means.
  </p>

  <p>
    More than any other part of an agent-authored pull request, inspect the tests. Make sure they’re testing something that matters. You decide what’s meaningful, the agent writes the tests, and your CI infrastructure runs them.
  </p>

    <h2 id="architecture">
      Architecture
    </h2>

  <p>
    Here's where agentic coding colliding with DevOps philosophy gets interesting and dangerous.
  </p>

  <p>
    Claude is remarkably tolerant of tight coupling. It will eat the maintenance pain of tangled dependencies far longer than any human team would. Rename a data model and watch it calmly rewrite half the repo without complaint. It doesn't miss a capitalization in camelCase. It just quietly absorbs the complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a genuine advantage. It means you can move fast on projects where the architecture isn't ideal, because the carrying cost of that mess is temporarily subsidized by an agent that can’t get frustrated.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>It is also a trap.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    Tight coupling that an AI can tolerate is still tight coupling. The moment you need to hand the codebase to a human for review, audit, or onboarding, the accumulated architectural debt lands all at once. And because Claude never complained, you might not realize how bad it’s become.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use Superpowers’ <a href="https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/main/skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md" title="GitHub" target="_blank">requesting-code-review</a> skill regularly. Ask Claude to explain why it touched files that seem unrelated to the task. If the answer is "because everything is connected to everything," that's your signal. Pay the debt while you can still afford it.
  </p>

    <h2 id="the-speed-of-ideas">
      The Speed of Ideas
    </h2>

  <p>
    If you’ve solved environments, deployment, testing, and architecture, you’re here. This is where you want to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two weeks ago, I took my niece to see <i>Avatar 3</i> and had a good thought about a project while waiting for the previews to start. Because I had Claude Code on the web connected to the repo and GitHub Actions handling the pipeline, I was able to take out my phone, type a prompt, and kick off work while I sat and shared a movie with a loved one. When the credits rolled I was able to review the PR, see working code, merge, and push to production before we got back to the car.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s when it all clicked into place. The bottleneck wasn’t tooling, infrastructure, or process. It was whether I had something worth building next. It didn’t matter if I was in a movie theater, at my desk kicking off three parallel sessions, or sitting on a plane with nothing but a browser tab.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bottleneck is no longer provisioning, deploying, testing, or untangling. It’s you. How fast can you articulate what “done” looks like? How precisely can you define success? How many good ideas can you feed the system before lunch?
  </p>

  <p>
    Kim said this is where the bottleneck should be. Now it’s on you.<br>

                    <p><img src="https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/8/screenshot.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="A hit!" /></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, I built a 3D physics simulation that runs in the browser. True, I’ve never used WebGL or touched Three.js, but the point isn’t that AI can write code. The point is that product intent now compiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started as a dare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday was game night. Cards were dealt, evil cultists were sacrificed, and afterward my friend Eric and I got to talking about Claude Code. He used to work in tech and got out before the AWS era. I tried to explain what it feels like if you’ve been around long enough to remember running </span><code><span style="font-weight: 400;">knife ec2 server create</span></code><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2011 and getting a working web server up in four minutes for $0.65. Or publishing a HyperCard deck to the web in 1993 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for free</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and linking it to someone else’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without asking</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It feels like one of those moments when the cost of building something drops to near zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was rightly skeptical. So I said, "If you've got an hour, we'll have a working prototype. Pick something."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided on a virtual dice tower. I fired up Claude with the Superpowers plugin, and we invoked the Brainstorm skill. Eric wasn’t expecting me to go hard, but what I described to the 'bot was a 3D dice tower where polyhedra tumble through baffles and land in a tray at the bottom. Real rigid-body physics. Particle effects on NAT20’s. Sound. The full experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I was showing off. But also, I wanted to see what would happen.</span></p>
<h1>The Interview</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://github.com/obra/superpowers"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superpowers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plugin is an agentic development framework by <a href="https://github.com/obra">Jesse Vincent</a>. When you start a project, Superpowers doesn't let Claude just start writing code in response to your prompts. It interviews you first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the interview is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It asked about the tower's visual style and proposed a stone-dungeon aesthetic, which I rejected. I wanted bone ivory, something eerie. It asked about camera movement and which dice types to model. It suggested the standard D&amp;D set and made sure I knew that, for a D100 roll, it would throw 2d10 and model one of them as a percentile die. In fact, Claude is the one who came up with the idea to add special effects to Natty 20’s and Nat 1’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are </span><strong>product questions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’re the kind of questions I'd expect from a sharp engineer pushing back on my loose “showing off to a buddy” spec. Claude asked them before writing a single line of code, then produced a design document broken into sections small enough for us to actually review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric and I read it over, made some edits, talked them through, and then I approved the spec. Claude built a parallelized implementation plan. Then it started building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prototype was ready in about 30 minutes. We opened the browser, clicked the “roll” button, and for about 3 seconds everything was magic. Then the dice passed through the tower walls and promptly fell into infinite nothingness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were lots of bugs, of course. It was the first compile, but the bones were there. Eric was convinced.</span></p>
<h1><strong>The Part Where It Got Hard</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easy stuff was, genuinely, easy. Claude scaffolded a Vite-powered TypeScript project, wired up Three.js for rendering and cannon-es for physics, built the tower geometry, lit the scenes, created all seven dice types, added particle effects for special rolls, and hooked up rudimentary sound effects. I directed. Claude built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superpowers also enforces test-driven development. Real red-green-refactor, the kind teams talk about and rarely sustain. Claude doesn’t pay lip service, it just does it. Not all the tests are perfect, but an executable definition of success gates every change. That still didn’t save us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was time to start smashing bugs, things got frustrating. Physics tuning was a whack-a-mole nightmare. Dice would fall through one baffle but get stuck on another. I'd tell Claude to fix the collision on baffle three, and it would overcorrect, breaking baffle one. We went back and forth for a while, me describing symptoms and Claude adjusting parameters, never quite converging on anything that worked consistently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I stopped describing symptoms and started defining acceptance criteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We’re wasting a lot of time chasing individual failures,” I told Claude. "Instead, write an end-to-end test: Dice enter the top of the tower, and dice arrive in the tray at the bottom. That's it. Iterate until you pass the test 40 times in a row."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claude wrote the test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it cheated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It set the friction coefficient to zero, turning the tower interior into a frictionless slide. Dice went in the top. Dice arrived in the tray. The test passed. But the dice didn't </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">roll</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they just slid down like they were on ice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I added another constraint: Dice must rotate a minimum number of times while in the tower. Claude solved </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by making the dice spring-loaded, leaping unrealistically as if they had been shocked every time they touched a baffle. I had to go around a few times before finding a balance that worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I did.</span></p>
<h1>Defining Success</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://github.com/charlesjohnson/arcane-dice-tower/" title="Arcane Dice Tower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcane Dice Tower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a progressive web app you can install on your phone or run in a browser. It supports the standard D&amp;D dice set, D4 through D100, with real rigid-body physics, camera tracking, critical hit animations for D20 rolls, and a die inspector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not perfect. The D10 geometry is messed up. The D6 doesn't roll enough. The camera tracks a little too slowly. If you put enough dice in the tower, some of them spill out into the void. The lighting needs work. The bone-ivory aesthetic came out looking like a weird purple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has bugs, and I'm sharing it anyway. The point is that it exists at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That application took six hours across less than a week. I have no experience with WebGL, the underlying node libraries, physics simulation, or 3D geometry. I didn’t grind through framework documentation, and full disclosure, I still don’t know what a quaternion is. The code came easy; initial implementation wasn’t the bottleneck.</span></p>

                    <p><img src="https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/5/Fresh-idea.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="An octopus cat hybrid freaking out a table of people" /></p>
                
  <p>
    I fired up Publii for the first time in a while today. I wanted to blog about a technical problem that was niche enough that an article might help the next person who runs into it. Instead, I found myself solving a sort-of-obtuse Publii issue, so I guess it's time to write two blog posts about niche technical problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Publii, the software I use to write this blog, will deprecate direct support for GitHub Pages in version 0.46. Instead, you'll need to use a direct Git connection. But there are some landmines, so I'll walk you through what I had to do to migrate this blog from using the GitHub Pages configuration to the straight Git configuration.
  </p>

    <h2 id="gather-information">
      Gather Information
    </h2>

  <p>
    First, you'll need to ensure you've got some information about the GitHub repository hosting your existing blog.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: 1em; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Your GitHub username (e.g.,&nbsp;</span><code style="font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); font-style: ; font-variant-ligatures: ; font-variant-caps: ;">charlesjohnson</code><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: 1em; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">&nbsp;)</span><br></li><li>The direct git link for the GitHub repo that hosts your site. This will be the URL to the repo with .git appended (e.g.,&nbsp;<code>https://github.com/charlesjohnson/publii-blog</code>).</li><li>A valid GitHub token. Follow the <a href="https://getpublii.com/docs/host-static-website-github-pages.html" target="_blank">instructions Publii posted here</a>.</li>
  </ol>

    <h2 id="configure-your-cname">
      Configure your CNAME
    </h2>

  <p>
    If your blog already uses a custom domain and contains a CNAME file, you'll have to manually set up that file in Publii&nbsp;before converting the site from a GitHub Pages connection to a Git connection. Otherwise, your site will vanish the next time you hit publish.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under "Tools &amp; Plugins," select File Manager.

    Note: At the time of this writing, the Test Connection button was broken for me on Publii 0.45.2. Your mileage may vary.

    <h2 id="conclusion">
      Conclusion
    </h2>

  <p>
    You should be ready to publish with the proper repository URL, CNAME, username, and a valid token. Click Publish to make sure everything works correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn't a particularly complicated migration, but land mines in the form of the CNAME file, the need to grab the entire repository URL ending in .git, and the requirement to generate a new token make it trickier than it otherwise needed to be. Now that Publii is reconfigured, I can return to the business of rarely updating it.

  <p>
    Say what you will about Twitter and its impact on our culture, but you can't deny that the people building it acted with passion and care. Since the end of October, when the company was bought out and taken private, those creators have watched helplessly as the new owners transformed the company and the project born of their dedication into something else entirely.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the change in management, many people working at Twitter had been wary of what the company's famously capricious billionaire suitor might do. But the reality turned out to be far crueler than they'd imagined, and conversations lamenting the destruction from current and former Twitter employees have dominated tech social media.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    For many of them, this was their first Lights Out moment.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Lights Out moments are a new phenomenon brought on by the internet age. Throughout history, most people have supported themselves by expressing ideas, creating and enforcing agreements with other humans,  or building and arranging tangible objects—things made of atoms. However, for those working on the internet, we can now make money by arranging electrons. And it turns out that specific configurations of electrons are extremely rewarding, and some are even extremely profitable!<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    But by their very nature, a pleasing configuration of electrons is a fleeting thing. As all of these Twitter employees are discovering, when you're an electron worker, all someone has to do to permanently erase your life's work is turn off the power. Lights Out.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not to say that it is rare or unusual for a person to see all of their efforts destroyed capriciously. But the incredible ease with which any number of phenomena can wipe them out is a new phenomenon of the electron worker. It is a bitter but necessary lesson for anyone who wants to be in tech, and I was lucky to learn it early in my career.

  <p>
    In 2005, I helped launch a cell phone company with a revolutionary idea: They had an app store that sold movies, TV shows, music, games, and communication tools, all from the handset. It seems passé now, but before iPhones, the concept was incredibly innovative. Unfortunately, they also tried to do it from clunky Kyocera slider phones.&nbsp;Amp'd couldn't even offer customers a Motorola RAZR for their first year in business.
  </p>
<div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yuiIew6Lfs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

  <p>
    To say it didn't work out is an understatement. AMP'd Mobile burned through $350M of investor cash in less than two years, arguably the last significant failure of the first .com era.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the lead systems admin on their infrastructure, I routinely put in 80-hour weeks with 24/7 on-call. I spent days sleeping on cots in warehouse data centers and eating fast food in the conference room, never seeing the sun while we racked giant SAN clusters and live-migrated data. I wrote new tooling to solve problems nobody else had ever solved before, putting the best of my creativity and life into the project. Get me in the right mood, and I might tell you the story about being wrecked out of my mind at a New Year's Eve party with a half-dozen other sysadmin friends, all of us slurring into a speakerphone at a poor NOC technician about how to kill and safely restart a desynched JBoss cluster.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was young, I was at the top of my game, and I gave Amp'd everything I had.
  </p>

  <p>
    One day, they stopped paying their bills, so we just... turned the servers off and never turned them back on. All of the best work of my young career went away with a shutdown command.
  </p>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/4/linux-shutdown.png" height="307" width="713" alt=""  sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/4/responsive/linux-shutdown-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/4/responsive/linux-shutdown-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/4/responsive/linux-shutdown-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/4/responsive/linux-shutdown-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/4/responsive/linux-shutdown-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.chipjohnson.net/media/posts/4/responsive/linux-shutdown-2xl.webp 1600w">
      
    </figure>

  <p>
    I had something of an existential crisis. Seeing how fragile and fleeting my best efforts were, what were they genuinely worth, in the end? It was incredibly humbling. Did I even want to do this kind of work anymore? How much of myself could I continue to put into my career?
  </p>

  <p>
    What did I want the impact of my life to be?
  </p>

  <p>
    In the fifteen years since Amp'd Mobile folded up, I've been part of a few more Lights Out events and have watched others experience them for the first time. I've tried to be there for dozens of my colleagues and friends as they've wrestled with these same questions. It hasn't been easy for anyone; some have become quite bitter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I imagine these same questions are what the Twitter alums are dealing with right now. It will be difficult for them, too. But this is a necessary step in the career for anyone who wants to arrange electrons for a living. Because the things we make, the ways we express our creativity, none of it is tangible. It can all go away with the press of a button. And we have to face that part of the bargain with our eyes open. Making something lasting of our lives is difficult, and very few of us will ever do it. But making something lasting with electrons? It might be damn near impossible.

    <i>(This post started life as a <a href="https://twitter.com/JefrsonStarChip/status/1583220749594071040?s=20&amp;t=v3KaY_evH0bkAp-6LugbVw">Twitter thread</a>.)</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    DHH has been getting lots of recent traction with a blog post about how his company, 37signals, is abandoning the cloud. Because he's DHH, this becomes a long rant about self-reliance and cutting out predatory middlemen. He says some things that seem so stunningly obvious to me they're not worth talking about, but he managed to get 1,000 words, countless page views, and a 30-minute podcast out of it, so hey! I guess maybe it is worth some discussion!
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's your tl;dr: The folks at 37signals have predictable workloads and a lot of in-house expertise around running servers &amp; networks in a data center. So they ran the numbers and figured out they'd save a lot of money by moving their applications out of the cloud and onto self-managed infrastructure. 
  </p>

  <p>
    That's it. That's the tweet. But DHH presents this as a stunning revelation when in reality, it's... Yeah? No shit? You can use Excel; congratulations. If I knew this silly little thought would blow minds, I'd have been saying it louder through the years.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>It should be obvious, but if you have predictable workloads and in-house infrastructure expertise, you will probably save money running your own infrastructure instead of using AWS.</b><br><br>Look, cloud hosting <i>can</i> run mature, low-maintenance apps for you. But that's not what it's for. The cloud was designed for rapid time-to-market. And it works! Now, if you want to create a wholly new experience on the internet, you can go home and get that idea in front of people before you go to sleep tonight. That's incredible.
  </p>

  <p>
    The barriers to creating a thing on the internet used to be enormous and expensive until the cloud tore those obstacles down. As a result, the number of people running workloads on the internet is many, many times greater than it was when, as DHH put it, "Everyone &amp; their dog [ran infrastructure] to get the internet off the ground."
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>My dog &amp; I also waited six months for Rackspace.com to provision new servers, my dude. </i>People today don't have that problem. They put in a credit card number and have all the computing power they need, billed by the hour.
  </p>

    <figure class="blockquote">
      <blockquote>The world doesn't need thousands of people who can expertly tune postfix, SpamAssassin, and ClamAV—the world has Gmail.</blockquote>
      <figcaption>Charity Majors</figcaption>
    </figure>

  <p>
    In a recent article, Charity Majors <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/future-ops-platform-engineering" target="_blank">wrote about the bifurcation of infrastructure engineering and operations engineering</a>. Infrastructure engineering is commoditizing because every company needs it, and no company can differentiate on it. DevOps isn't dead, it's alive and well, and you can buy it off the shelf.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, Operations Engineering is getting a new name because we're technologists, <i style="font-weight: bold;">that's what we do here, </i>and we&nbsp;seem to have settled on Platform Engineering. Because <s>Operations</s> Platform Engineering remains mostly bespoke, while Infrastructure Engineering has commoditized, the tides of economic inevitability crashed. Someone figured out that as the roles decoupled, they could build a tollgated API between the two roles, and make a lot of money.&nbsp;We call that tollgate API the cloud.
  </p>

  <p>
    To put it another way: Running servers? As Jeff Barr says, that's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/we_build_muck_s/" target="_blank">undifferentiated heavy lifting</a>. But running my site and services? You bet your ass that company runbook is a trade secret.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>(A brief aside: Kubernetes is the foundation of the latest attempt to commodify operations expertise. It's going better than the last couple of dozen times people tried to do this, but it's still not there. A true Kubernetes expert currently costs about $500k/year, and they're worth every penny. So... not a commodity.)</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    What does this all mean? First, you can be a tech company without any infrastructure expertise. You can do it <i>in minutes</i> with just a credit card. You can ignore the infrastructure parts and put all your focus square on your customers. And it means that in those early days of pinching pennies and wild swings in requirements, when you might need a memory cache one day and a bunch of web servers the next, until you need to <b>stop paying for all of that ASAP </b>to try something else, you can adapt before you wind up dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    These are <i>superpowers.</i>&nbsp;It is <i>awesome</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    But once your product has matured, growth is steady, and you can make accurate predictions about your customer usage, all that flexibility stops meaning very much. And like most things rented by the hour, the cloud is expensive when you add it up to weeks, months, and years. So when you've got time to breathe and look around, you might find yourself a vast cloud bill. And if you've got the chops and some free time, well...
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm just going to say it again: <b>If you have predictable workloads and in-house infrastructure expertise, you will probably save money running your own infrastructure instead of using AWS.</b><br>
  </p>

  <p>
    What a dull, obvious sentence! I think it's boring, anyway. I got bored saying it to you. But leave it to a polemicist to turn a sensible business decision into a, uh, polemic:
  </p>

    <figure class="blockquote">
      <blockquote>Up until very recently, everyone ran their own servers, and much of the progress in tooling that enabled the cloud is available for your own machines as well. Don't let the entrenched cloud interests dazzle you into believing that running your own setup is too complicated...&nbsp;It's time to part the clouds and let the internet shine through.</blockquote>
      <figcaption>David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH)</figcaption>
    </figure>

  <p>
    Fuck right off with this attitude. If a product is no longer for you, don't buy it. But the cloud has done wonders to lower barriers to access and democratize the internet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Doing commoditized things like Infrastructure Engineering in-house makes sense at some scales. But it's not a political act; it's an economic one. Don't let nostalgia for the days when you kept the dark magicks of <code>make installworld</code> for yourself convince you otherwise.

                <p>I'm going over my ballot for this November, and I thought writing a voter guide might be an excellent way to get my thoughts in order about the election. This post is 100% inspired by/blatantly aping David Glasser's awesome voter guides. I stole a lot of his format.<br><br>I have to confess a certain amount of hopelessness about national politics. Republicans are maneuvering to take the vote away from anyone who isn't white while simultaneously pushing to make political gerrymandering legal and irreversible. If they have their way, this election might mark the end of the American experiment. Trumpism is flourishing! The former president's outright treason is going unpunished, while fascism and political violence are prevalent. I always used to scoff when people of my parent's generation told me Gen-X would fuck up the country! But here we are, and they were right.<br><br>Still, California will remain solidly progressive. Our federal representatives are going to be Democratic. The statehouse party supermajority is isn't threatened. That makes this election mostly about local races and ballot initiatives.</p>

<h1>Partisan Races</h1>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Democrat down the ticket. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I've not consistently voted Democrat over my lifetime. But the modern Republican party has embraced fascism and political violence. Until they repudiate these stances, I never see myself voting for the party again.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">People are not their politics! I know many shithead progressives and Republicans that would give you the boots off their feet. I don't hold that all Republicans are bad people, but these days I do start from that assumption until they prove themselves otherwise.</span></p>
<h1>Judges</h1>
<p><strong>Yes to all. </strong>These are up-or-down votes about keeping judges in office. As David pointed out, the League of Pissed-Off Voters recommends voting yes on everybody. Honestly, that's good enough for me.</p>
<h1 id="state-superintendent-of-public-instruction-tony-thurmond">State Superintendent of Public Instruction</h1>
<p><strong>Thurmond. </strong>I'll quote David Glasser here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one doesn’t say “Democrat vs Republican” on the ballot, but it is. Thurmond has apparently not been as great as hoped for in office. But Christensen is a Christian supremacist who wants to bring staff-led prayer to public schools. Vote Thurmond!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="district-attorney-pamela-price">County Supervisor</h1>
<p><strong>Rebecca Kaplan. </strong>This is a tragic race. In a significant loss for the region, the incumbent, Wilma Chan, was struck and killed by a motorist about a year ago. She was an Alameda local and I met her a few times. By all accounts she was a good person and public servant.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have an embarrassment of riches in choosing her successor: Lena Tam was an excellent vice-mayor for Alameda, and I loved being her constituent. I've voted for her before; she'd do a good job. Kaplan was vice mayor of Oakland and is a single-issue candidate focused on homelessness. That's very attractive, and she's proposing innovative solutions. We won't go wrong either way.</p>
<h1 id="district-attorney-pamela-price">District Attorney</h1>
<p><strong>Pamela Price. </strong>David has written glowing recommendations for Pamela Price in the past. Pamela has the criminal reform endorsements, and Terry Wiley has the political machine endorsements. I don't think either will be a disaster, but David's considerable enthusiasm tilts me toward Pamela.</p>
<h1>AUSD Governing Board</h1>
<p><strong>Ryan Lalonde &amp; Gary Lim.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Ryan Lalonde reached out to me directly (validation endorphins!) with corrections. I was completely wrong!<strong> </strong>This is <em>totally</em> a maskers vs anti-maskers race, <em>and</em> one of the anti-maskers <a href="https://alamedapost.com/news/lwva-ausd-board-of-education-candidate-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the league of Women Voters that she opposes LGBTQ curriculum</a>. Local blogger Lauren Do <a href="https://laurendo.wordpress.com/2022/10/13/pay-you-in-coupons/#more-34636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also had choice things to say about the race</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I mainly want to ensure this wasn't one of those races where the Trumpists are trying to get some COVID-denier shithead onto the school board. Fortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">All the candidate information online is pretty milquetoast, so in the end, I went with the California Teacher's Association endorsements.</span></p>
<h1>AC Transit Races</h1>
<p><strong>Alfred Twu &amp; Sarah Syed. </strong>David has glowing recommendations for Alfred Twu, and Sarah Syed's credentials and experience are extremely impressive. These both seem like no-brainers.</p>
<h1>City of Alameda Mayor</h1>
<p><strong>Marilyn Ashcraft. </strong><strong>No on Trish. </strong>Marilyn Ashcraft has been an excellent mayor of Alameda. Between COVID and the state legislature entering into a "pro-growth-or-else" posture toward city governments, she's done a fantastic job.</p>
<p>Ashcraft brought us through the COVID emergency while minimizing the economic impact on local business. She has shepherded the city through creating a compliant California Housing Element, and the city transit plans designed under her leadership emphasize bicycles and pedestrians over cars. In addition, city council meetings once again run smoothly on her watch. It's been a harder time than usual to lead a city in California, and Marilyn Ashcraft has been a formidable wartime mayor.</p>
<p>On top of that, Ashcraft has been pro-tenant in a city where more than half of residents are renters. That's a big deal, even for homeowners like me.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I love all of that, but in the end I'm a single-issue voter in Alameda city politics, and that issue is whether the owners of the Harbor Bay Club will be allowed to redevelop their site into housing. Earlier this year, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://alamedasun.com/news/development-company-applies-redevelop-harbor-bay-club-site" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">these jackasses proposed bulldozing the run-down tennis club next to my house and replacing it with an apartment tower featuring a 600-space parking garage. They wanted to build it about 60 feet from my home, with the parking garage entrance pointed directly at my front door</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. That proposal was ultimately defeated, but it's hardly the last attempt at redevelopment by the people who own the site. </span>Ashcraft hasn't precisely committed to opposing such a plan, but she's spoken in that direction:</p>
<blockquote class="">

<div class="">According to Planning, Building &amp; Transportation Director Andrew Thomas, "It is not an unreasonable request" to change the current zoning of the Harbor Bay Club (HBC) to make it consistent with the site's General Plan designation which is "Commercial Recreation" and would preclude housing. Mr. Thomas also noted significant concerns with the HBC site, including the need to address sea level rise. I have worked with Mr. Thomas since 2006 when I was appointed to the Planning Board and find his reasoning thorough and persuasive.</div>

<p>That's not an "I would definitely oppose development there," but it's good enough for me.</p>
<p>All that said, I wasn't in love with how her government handled multiple police scandals, including the murder of a man in custody. On the contrary, I'm disappointed by the lack of consequences for the officers involved. But I voted for Ashcraft once, and I'll do it again.</p>
<p>By contrast, her opponent Trish Spencer is a trash fire of a candidate. Spencer was the incumbent ousted by Ashcraft, and her time as mayor was chaos. Multiple scandals. Alameda-sized scandals, but still. Council meetings ran long. Police quit in droves. People in city hall found her difficult.</p>
<p>Spencer's been on the city council since losing the mayoral race, and her time on the city council has been characterized by obstruction and NIMBYism. I am relieved that I do not have to vote for Trish to protect my home.</p>
<p>Vote yes on Ashcraft. But just as important, vote no on Spencer.</p>
<h1>City of Alameda City Council</h1>
<p><strong>Hannah Groce &amp; Paul Beusterien. </strong>The Alameda City Council race is crowded this year, with six candidates vying for two open positions. The election determines whether we'll have a progressive vs. moderate majority in the city council. The progressives will continue to push alternatives to cars in our transit plan and favor renter protections. Moderates will go hard to reverse existing tenant protections, oppose building more housing, and will likely continue the typical California NIMBY tactics to slow growth.</p>
<p>I favor Hannah Groce (progressive) and Paul Beusterien (moderate). Tracy Jensen is also a great candidate and my alternate to Paul B.</p>
<p>It seems like I don't need to explain my choice for Hannah Groce very much. She's got the progressive bona fides; she'll do great.</p>
<p>I favor Paul Beusterien for two reasons. First, we don't have anyone representing my neighborhood on the city council, and Paul's from Bay Farm. More than that, he serves on the master HOA board that covers nearly 4000 households and does so well. If you'd like to check for yourself, his voting record as part of that HOA board is an open record. I think he's ready to level up to full city council.</p>
<p>But that's not enough to get me behind him entirely in a race that has this many candidates. What pushes me over the line is that I am confident that Paul will be on my side in the fight against the redevelopment of the Harbor Bay Club site. Paul actually came to our neighborhood, talked with us about the issue, and listened. No other candidate has done so.<br><br>Paul generally favors solutions that protect the tennis club site as commercial recreation and wants to find ways to restore it to vibrancy. I prefer non-commercial solutions myself, but this is close enough. He has my vote.</p>
<h1>Measure 1 (legal abortion)</h1>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hell yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This measure will enshrine the right to abortion, birth control, and the right to refuse birth control into the state constitution. With forced birth now the law of the land in half of the United States, the country needs California to lead here. It's a no-brainer.</span></p>
<h1>Measure 26 (expand tribal casinos)</h1>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>I guess yes.</strong> I dislike gambling; I've seen it ruin too many lives. But I favor tribal sovereignty and dislike prohibitions. So I'll hold my nose and vote yes.</span></p>
<h1>Measure 27 (online sports betting)</h1>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>No. </strong>Another gambling proposition. Again, I dislike prohibitions, but Measure 28 is designed as a corporate end-run around the California state legislature, who could pass laws legalizing this type of betting if they wanted to. They don't want to, so well-funded predators are trying to capture business from the tribal casinos via ballot initiative. Fuck these people.</span></p>
<h1>Measure 28 (arts in schools)</h1>
<p><strong>Hell yes. </strong>It sucks that we have to do all this dancing around Prop 13 to get our schools funded, but that's life. Every kid in California should have the opportunity to make art, and underfunded schools deserve arts programs.</p>
<h1>Measure 29 (Dialysis Clinics Again)</h1>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unions have been trying to protect the workers in California dialysis clinics for a long time, and powerful medical lobbies have effectively shut them out. The unions have put worker protections on the ballot in the last few elections, and every time they get outspent ten to one and lose. The clinics claim all their patients will die because they'll all close down if they had to treat their workers like human beings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The unions are trying again this year, and the (wildly profitable) dialysis clinic companies are trotting out ads featuring old ladies begging us not to murder them. It's sick.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I doubt any clinics will close if this passes, but it won't. I'm pro-union, so I'm voting yes anyway.</span></p>
<h1>Measure 30 (Tax the rich to fund electric cars)</h1>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So Lyft will save some money, so fucking what? We're in a climate emergency, and the rich don't have to pay federal income taxes. Make their accountants earn those fees by dancing around this tax too. The worst case scenario here, if it passes, is that we get more electric cars, and billionaires don't buy their way out of future taxes at the ballot. Tax the rich! What's controversial about that?</span></p>
<h1>Measure 31 (Keep law banning flavored tobacco)</h1>
<p><strong>Soft yes.</strong> Measure 31 is a big company trying to buy a veto around the state legislature via a ballot initiative. Again, I don't like prohibitions, but I dislike big corporations trying to buy their way past the state legislature even more. Fight it in the state house, not at the ballot initiative, and support representative democracy.</p>
<h2 id="alameda-county-d-more-buildings-on-agricultural-land-yes">Alameda County D (buildings on agricultural land)</h2>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This one is deep policy wonk stuff. Alameda County prohibits building on many agricultural lands; this allows limited development for equestrian and agricultural buildings. The county supervisors proposed and support it, and the Sierra Club has no opinion, so I will trust the supervisors to do their jobs.</span></p>
<h1>City of Alameda E (City council pay increases)</h1>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hell Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Serving in elected city leadership in Alameda pays jack shit. City council members make $1200 a year, and the mayor makes $3600 a year. True, city leadership is a part-time job in a city structured in a weak-mayor, strong-city-manager way, but those numbers are too low. We're asking our elected officials to work for free, which cuts everyone out of the candidate pool who can't afford to do that.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If this passes, the city council's pay will jump to $25,000 in 2023. Future pay increases would be based on a formula not to exceed 30 percent of the median Bay Area annual salary, which is... weird? But not unreasonable. They haven't had a raise since the 1970s; we should do it.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you want professionals in the job, pay them like professionals.</span></p>
<h1>City of Alameda F (Hotel taxes)</h1>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Yes. </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This increases the hotel tax to 14%, in line with other cities in the area. It sucks because it's a direct voting tax, not something the city council can set itself. But that's life in California for you. But I don't see a downside beyond entrenching our existing government dysfunction.</span></p>
